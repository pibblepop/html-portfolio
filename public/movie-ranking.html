<h1>The Best Movies According to Tyler</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Harlem Nights</h3>
<p>This is my all-time favorite comedy classic. Timeless stars and the plot make this movie great.</p>
<h3>Stripes</h3>
<p>This is my favorite because its the one that my dad and I watched together the most. Bill Murray is hilarious in it too.</p>
<h3>X</h3>
<p>This is my favorite because its the last movie I went to see in a theater with my mom. Also, Denzell Washington's portrayal of Malcom X makes it a classic.</p>
